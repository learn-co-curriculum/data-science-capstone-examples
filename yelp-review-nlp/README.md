# Abstract

This project comprises analysis of review data collected from [yelp.com](https://www.yelp.com) for various restaurants in the Albany, NY area. The goal of the project is to extract important words and phrases from review data for many restaurants at different rating levels and to provide an ability to classify 'unrated' text reviews into a predicted rating level.

**Question/Problem:** How can we leverage yelp review data to give us insights about our business?

**Why?** The ability to analyze and extract information from customers has great value to a business that can leverage that data to continuously improve. Validation of sentiment analysis from review text will allow the same type of analysis to be performed on non-rated, review-like text data that can be found on social media or comment/discussion boards.

**Infomation Generated:**
- Review **text sentiment** compared to star rating.
- Common **phrasing** used in review text.
- Review text **sentiment over time**.
- TF/IDF analysis to determine **keywords** in business star rating levels.
- Word Embedding Analysis to determine **relationships between words** withing the space.
- **Classification of review text** using word embeddings.

**Process:** First, Data Gathering was performed with all review data being scraped prior to analysis. Then, data cleaning, word/document embeddings and keyword analysis were performed. Lastly, classification models were tuned to the cleaned and tokenized review texts and used to predict rating levels.

# Results Summary

NLP analysis shows that from raw Yelp review text, we can extract useful information for both modeling and business improvement. Sentiment analysis on review text revealed that **review star ratings are consistent with text sentiment**. Sentiment analysis over time allows for a business to measure how its standing relative to competitors has changed over time.

Additionally, **phrase and TF/IDF analysis can be used to extract keywords** from reviews. Applying this analysis to restaurant categories and rating levels allowed for **identification of important key phrases for a business at each rating level**. **Word embeddings** applied in a similar fashion allow for contextual measurment within a category where **most similar words and phrases** are output for a list of keywords or any desired search term. 

**Modeling** of cleaned and tokenized review text shows that raw text can be used to **predict a review star rating**. The implication being that non-rated text gathered from additional resources (Facebook comments, Twitter, etc.) can be classified and used for analysis and keyword extraction. **Keywords are used to help a business identify areas of success and areas where improvement is needed.**

# Dashboard

An online dashboard with a subset of the data can be found at the following link. It allows selection of a restaurant for inspection where a user can view the sentiment and review ratings over time, the distribution of reviews and a visual representation of keywords. From there, individual reviews can be seen based on the selected or manually entered keyword.

# Recommendations and Future Work

Businesses should use the keywords identified as a way to learn about what customers think of their business, which dishes are most/least successful, and to gain insights about customer service. Additionally, sentiment scores over time provide trending of review sentiment. This can indicate an upward/downward trend that business owners should monitor and potentially react-to accordingly. The dashboard allows for viewing reviews based on the identified keywords thereby providing the necessary details of the review if desired.  

Additional sources of review-like text data could be gathered and incorporated into the dataset. The text data would be assigned a rating level using the tuned classification model. Then, these reviews can be used to extract keywords, sentiment values, and to generate contextual information in the same manner that scraped reviews were used in this project. 

The classification models themselves can be further improved with adjustments to vector dimensionality, and model parameters.

Additional features to be added include trend analysis of keyword frequency based on time. This would open the door to see what keywords are being used over time for a particular business or within a particular category. Incorporating better word-cloud visualization capability would be a good way to improve presentation of keyword information.

# Data Gathering
All web scraping is completed in [Project_Data_Gathering.ipynb](Project_Data_Gathering.ipynb) notebook. 1081 restaurants were identified using the search query 'restaurants' in 'Albany, NY' on Yelp.com. From those businesses, 59274 reviews were gathered for analysis. A subset of this data is included in the Github repository. There are two different structures of Yelp review pages (using different class labels and slightly different structures), for this reason, two scraping functions are used to collect review data.


# NLP and Data Analysis

The [Project_NLP.ipynb](Project_NLP.ipynb) notebook uses instances of _Restaurant_ and _Review_ objects to organize and process the data. A Restaurant contains a list of reviews. Review objects contain methods for cleaning, tokenizing, stopword removal, polarity assignment, and general extraction of review text in various formats. Restaurant objects contain methods for adding reviews, extracting various review summary information (time/sentiment), retrieving review objects or review text in various formats.

## Sentiment Distribution

Review sentiment distributions by star rating show distinct peaks with review positivity increasing with each star rating. Sentiment was measured using the python `textblob` library. The distribution of sentiment validates that review text itself is a good indicator for star rating. See distribution for all reviews below:

The NLP jupyter notebook further allows sentiment distribution based upon a category search term.

## Sentiment Over Time

Once sentiment has been applied to each review object, review sentiment over time for a specific restaurant or a list of restaurants (for comparison purposes) can be viewed.

## Keywords Extraction

Phrasing of review text was performed using `Phraser` from `gensim.models.phrases`. The text was fit and transformed using the phraser twice. The first time to generate bigrams, the second to generate trigrams. Once phrasing was completed. Before the phrasers were applied, stopwords were removed (this proved to give more informative phrase results).

Keywords were extracted for each restaurant by star rating level. This was done by creating a document of reviews for each restaurant at each star rating level and then performing the TF/IDF analysis to the document set. A review document for a restaurant was compared to other restaurant documents within common cuisine type categories. An `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer` was used to fit documents and retrieve TF/IDF scores for words from specific documents.

**Example Restaurant:** Madison Pour House - _American (New), Pubs_

Positive Ratings           |  Negative Ratings

## Most Similar Analysis

Word similarities can be seen through the use of word embedding models created at the rating level as well as the individual restaurant level. A `gensim.models.Word2Vec` vectorizer was used with 20 dimensions to create word vector models.

Most similar words/phrases to **beer_selection, draft,** and **service** using word vector models created for each rating level:

* **5.0 rating:** beer_list, drink_selection, selection_beers, family_owned_restaurant, services, people_work, wine_selection, noshes
* **4.0 rating:** beer_list, open_till, drink_menu, beers_tap, wine_list, selection_tap, eclectic_menu, service_impeccable
* **3.0 rating:** wine_list, entertainment, positives, excellent_service, wine_selection, servers_always, payton, friendly_wait_staff
* **2.0 rating:** bordering, slow_night, pace, welcoming, outdoor_space, horrible_service, terrible_service, waiter_attentive
* **1.0 rating:** service_terrible, oof, drink_selection, nature, excursion, last_times, though, taste_mouth

Using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction from sklearn.manifold.TSNE, a word cloud displaying word/phrase similarity can be viewed. 

* **5.0 rating** word cloud for same key phrases (beer_selection, draft, and service).

# Data Modeling

In order to predict star rating for any block of text, various models were tested using GridSearchCV and Pipelines from sklearn. The model-types tested were: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and a Keras LSTM Network.

**CLASSIFICATION METRIC USED** 

**Custom Accuracy.** Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions. The custom accuracy score used is a modified version of the traditional accuracy score. As reviews are rated on a 1-5 scale, full credit is given to correct preditions and 50% credit to predictions that are 1 star rating away from the true label (i.e. 50% credit given to 1-star predictions when the true label is 2-stars). This was seen as a better optimization metric as misclassification in an adjacent group is better than other misclassifications.

**MODEL TYPE CHOSEN** 
- sklearn.svm.SVC - Support Vector Classifier

**MODEL PARAMETERS** 
- *gamma*='auto' 
- *C*=1.0
- *kernel*='rbf'

**CONFUSION MATRIX**

Training Data           |  Test Data
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="./images/confusion_matrix_train_data.png" width=100%>  |  <img src="./images/confusion_matrix_test_data.png" width=100%>


Notes:

The Keras LSTM Network model performed very well. In fact, it performed better than the SVC model on both the training and test data. However, I chose the SVC model because it was less prone to overfitting and performed similarly between the training data and test data.
